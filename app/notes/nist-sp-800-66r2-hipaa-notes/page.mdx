# Summary of Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule

<br />

[NIST SP 800-66r2](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-66r2), with all the tables and annexes is over 100 pages long.
It is a great guide, but I needed something a little simpler to work with and ended up with a much shorter version.
When implementing the Security Rule, you are highly encouraged to refer to the full guide which contains a lot more information.

# Executive Summary

<br />

SP 800-66r2 aims to help educate readers about the security standards included in the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule, as
amended by the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach
Notification Rules Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
Act [HITECH] and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and Other Modifications to
the HIPAA Rules [OMNIBUS], in their **implementation** of the Security Rule.

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI) held or maintained by regulated entities. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits **must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats**, hazards, and **impermissible uses and/or disclosures**.

The Security Rule is flexible, scalable and technology-neutral. For that reason, there is no single compliance approach that will work for all regulated entities.

The HIPAA SecRule focuses on safeguarding **confidentiality, integrity and availability** of ePHI. All regulated entities must comply with the Security Rule

The security rule is separated into 6 main sections, each including several standards that a regulated entity must meet. Many of the standards contain **implementation specifications.**

An implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach to meet a given standard.

Implementation **specifications** are either **required** or **addressable**. Entities must perform an assessment to determine which of the addressable is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard.

The Assessment, Analysis and management of **risk to ePHI** provides the foundation for a regulated entity Security Rule compliance efforts and the protection of ePHI.

The publication includes mappings of the Security Rule’s standards and implementation
specifications to the Security Rule to **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **NIST 800-53r5** (Security and privacy controls for Information Systems and Organizations).

## 1. Introduction

“A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.”

**Business associates** maintain their own **direct liability** under the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules (collectively, the “HIPAA Rules”)

Business associates are required to comply with the Security Rule in its entirety; business associate breach notification obligations differ from that of a covered entity; and business associates are subject to liability for only certain provisions of the Privacy Rule.

WARNING: This document does not directly address provisions in the HIPAA Privacy, Breach Notification, or Enforcement Rules.

## 2. HIPAA Security Rule

The Security Rule applies to the following regulated entities:

- Healthcare provider (supplies or transmits health information)
- Health Plans - provides or pays the cost of modecla care (eg: insurances)
- Healthcare clearinghouses - process healthcare transactions of another entity, transforming data
- Business Associate - entity that performs activities that involve the use or disclosure of ePHI, on behalf of or provides services to a covered entity. A BA is liable for it sown HIPAA Security Rules violations.

### 2.1 Security Rule Goals and Objectives

- Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all ePHI that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits;
- Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity of ePHI;
- Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not permitted by the Privacy Rule; and
- Ensure compliance with the Security Rule by its workforce.

**Definitions**

- **Confidentiality** is “the property that data or information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.”
- **Integrity** is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.”
- **Availability** is “the property that data or information is accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person.”

### 2.2. Security Rule Organization

The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications that a regulated entity must address.

1. **Security Standards: General Rules** — Includes the general requirements that all regulated entities must meet, establishes flexibility of approach, identifies standards and implementation specifications (both required and addressable), outlines decisions that a regulated entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications, and requires the maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate protection of ePHI
2. **Administrative Safeguards** — Defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative actions and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development, implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity’s workforce in relation to the protection of that information”
3. **Physical Safeguards** — Defined as the “physical measures, policies, and procedures to protect a covered entity’s electronic information systems and related buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion”
4. **Technical Safeguards** — Defined as “the technology and the policy and procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it”
5. **Organizational Requirements** — Includes standards for business associate contracts and other arrangements between a covered entity and a business associate and between a business associate and a subcontractor, as well as requirements for group health plans
6. **Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements** — Requires the implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the Security Rule; the maintenance of written (may be electronic) documentation and/or records that include the policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required by the Security Rule; and retention, availability, and update requirements related to the documentation

A regulated entity is required to comply with all of the standards of the Security Rule with
respect to all of its ePHI. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications (see Table 1).
An implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or
approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard.

Implementation specifications are either **required** or **addressable**. However, regardless of whether a standard
includes implementation specifications, regulated entities must comply with each standard.

- A **required** implementation specification is similar to a standard in that a regulated entity must comply with it.
- To meet the **addressable** implementation specifications, a regulated entity must (i) assess whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in its environment when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting the ePHI and (ii) as applicable to the regulated entity:

  - Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or
  - If implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and appropriate, (1) **document** why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to implement the implementation specification, and (2) **implement an equivalent alternative measure** that is reasonable and appropriate.

Regulated entities are required to document these assessments and all decisions

Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular
standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation” standards,
compliance with the standard itself is required.

Table 1. Security Rule standards and implementation specifications

## 3. Risk Assessment Guidance

Risk **assessment** and risk **management** processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s
compliance with the Security Rule and the safeguarding of ePHI.

The purpose of a risk assessment is to i**dentify conditions** where ePHI could be used or
disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed.
The **results of the risk assessment are used to make risk management decisions** on the implementation of security measures required by the Security Rule to bring risk to ePHI into an organizationally established **risk tolerance** range (i.e., reasonable and appropriate level) or if additional security controls are necessary.

**Key Terms Defined**

- **Threat events** are circumstances or **events** that can have a **negative impact on ePHI** (either intentional or unintentional, including misconfigurations, errors, etc.)
- **Threat sources** refer to the intent and method targeted at causing harm to ePHI (natural, human, environmental)
- **Vulnerabilities** are flaws or weaknesses in a system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat event.
- **Likelihood** refers to the probability that a given threat event is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability to cause harm.
- **Impact** refers to the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and/or the availability of ePHI.
- **Risk** refers to the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. Risk is typically a function of the likelihood and impact calculations.

### 3.1. HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements

Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to:

```bash
Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain,
and correct security violations.
```

The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation
specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis
and risk management:

1. **Risk Analysis** (R) — 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough **assessment** of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.

2. **Risk Management** (R) — 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): **Implement security measures** sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to **comply** with Section 164.306(a).

### 3.2. How to Conduct the Risk Assessment

Risk assessment methodology described in [IR 8286A] and [SP 800-30].

These steps should be customized to effectively identify risk for a regulated entity. The steps listed are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps could be conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.

**1. Prepare for the assessment.**

Determine where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, and transmitted. Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where and how it enters the organization (e.g., web portals), where it moves and flows within the organization (e.g., to specific information systems), where it is stored, and where it leaves the organization. Determine whether ePHI is transmitted to external third parties, such as cloud service providers or other service providers. The regulated entity can also note how access to ePHI is controlled and whether ePHI is encrypted in storage and in transit.

Include both physical and logical boundaries.

**2. Identify reasonably anticipated threats.**

The regulated entity identifies the potential threat events and threat sources that are applicable to it and its operating environment.

**3. Identify potential vulnerabilities and predisposing conditions**

For any of the various threats identified above to result in an impactful risk, each needs a **vulnerability or predisposing condition** that can be exploited. A **vulnerability** is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation
that could be exploited by a threat source. A **predisposing condition** is a condition that exists within an organization, a mission/business process, or information system that contributes to (i.e., increases or decreases) the likelihood that a threat event will result in adverse impacts once initiated.

The regulated entity develops a list of vulnerabilities (i.e., flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by potential threat sources.

**4. Determine the likelihood that a threat will exploit a vulnerability.**

The regulated entity determines the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a vulnerability.
For each threat event/threat source identified in Step 2, consider:
_ The likelihood that the threat will occur
_ The likelihood that an occurred threat would exploit a vulnerability identified in Step 3 and result in an adverse impact

A regulated entity might consider assigning a likelihood value (e.g., very low, low,
moderate, high, or very high) to each threat/vulnerability pairing

**5. Determine the impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.**

The regulated entity determines the impact that could occur to ePHI if a threat event were to exploit a
vulnerability. e.g. Loss of Confidentiality, Loss of Integrity, Loss of Availability.

**6. Determine the level of risk.**

Assess level of risk to ePHI with information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps.

**7. Document the risk assessment results.**

Regulated entities may benefit from documenting the risk assessment results in a risk register

## 4. Risk Management Guidance

Based on IR 8286

### 4.1. HIPAA Risk Management Requirements

Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to:

```bash
Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain,
and correct security violations
```

The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation
specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management.

1. **Risk Analysis** (R) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or business associate.
2. **Risk Management** (R) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with Section 164.306(a)

### 4.2. Determining Risks to ePHI in Accordance With Organizational Risk Tolerance

NIST IR 8286A presents two concepts — **risk appetite** and **risk tolerance** — that may be helpful to regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.

**Risk appetite **regarding cybersecurity risks is declared **at the enterprise** (i.e., highest) level of the organization and provides a **guidepost** to the types and amount of risk that senior leaders are** willing to accept** in pursuit of mission objectives.

**Risk tolerance** represents the specific level of performance risk deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership.

Regulated entities may choose to express risk tolerance qualitatively (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High) in alignment with the guidance presented in Sec. 3.

```bash
  Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct. Where risk
  appetite statements define the overarching risk guidance, risk
  tolerance statements define the specific application of that direction.
  This means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than
  the corresponding risk appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and
  risk tolerance statements represent risk limits that can assist
  regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.
```

### 4.3. Selecting Additional Security Controls to Reduce Risk to ePHI

A regulated entity may determine that there are identified **risks** to ePHI that **cannot be brought**
**within established risk tolerance by any standards**, required implementation specifications, or
addressable implementation specifications in the Security Rule. Regulated entities should
consider **implementing additional security controls** to reduce the risk to ePHI to established
risk tolerance.

### 4.4. Documenting Risk Management Activities

As with the risk assessment, risk management activities should be documented.

## 5. Considerations When Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule

This section presents security measures that are relevant to each standard of the Security Rule.

(ii) A covered entity is in compliance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it has another arrangement in place that meets the requirements of §164.504(e)(3).

(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section apply to the contract or other arrangement between a business associate and a subcontractor required by § 164.308(b)(4) in the same manner as such requirements apply to contracts or other arrangements between a covered entity and business associate.

Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to organizations. To the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, **HIPAA treats them the same as covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance**. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain **written satisfactory assurances** from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a BAA. These requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate.
