### Flaws & Strengths

The idea about the Flaws and Strengths sections comes from Gitlab's CEO own [page](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/ceo/).
His introduction to Flaws resonated well with me, and I decided to keep it
pretty much the same.

### Flaws

Transparency and directness are part of the values I live for. The main flaws are listed below for two main reasons.
The first one is for people to be aware of them so that they know it's not them but my fault.
The second one is so that I can improve.

- In meetings I may look a wee bit too serious. This is usually because I am usually very focused and paying attention, often in a foreign language. It is OK to remind me to 'smile more'.
- I may sometimes struggle to patiently listen until the end and will propose a 'solution'. I am a problem solver by nature, and sometimes can act instinctively.
- I don't particularly enjoy <em>lengthy</em> discussions on topics I happen to have invested a considerable amount of time researching with people that have <em>strong opinions</em>, but cannot be bothered to invest time to also learn at least the basics of the subject being discussed.
- I sometimes answer email/messages after working-hours or on weekends.

### Strengths

- We can discuss any subject. I often have 'strong opinions, weakly held' and have no problem changing my mind if the reasons and logic are sound.
- I love learning. I enjoy working on complex problems where we can collectively work toward a solution.
- I openly admit when I am wrong. I take ownership of my decisions.
- I deeply care about the well-being of the people that work with me.
- I value and appreciate feedback.
- I praise in public, and discuss issues in private.

### How to work with me

- Come prepared to meetings.
- I cannot fix what I am not aware of. When in doubt, talk to me.
- I treat people with respect, and I expect the same in return. Not because of authority, just basic human decency.
- Don't make me chase you for stuff we agreed. Once you commit to something, it is your responsibility to drive it forward and keep me updated. The same applies to me, of course.
