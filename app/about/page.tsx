         <h3 className="mt-8" id="name">Random Punctuation</h3>
          <p>
            The name <b>randompunctuation.com</b> comes from a comment a former colleague made many years ago while reviewing an article I wrote. He basically told me that it seemed I randomly added punctuation marks and it made the text harder to read. 
            He was right, and the name stuck.

            English is not my mother tongue and I am also a littlb eit dyslexic (that's a joke, btw). Writing well is indeed a challenge despite the availability of spelling and grammar checkers. 
            I was told that the best way to improve is to write, and therefore this blog.
            Feedback is welcome.
