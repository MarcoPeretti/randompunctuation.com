# About

Brief background about myself. A brief summary of my professional accomplishments can be found [here](/work).

### Random Punctuation

The name **randompunctuation.com** comes from a comment a former colleague made many years ago while reviewing an article I wrote. He basically told me that it seemed I randomly added punctuation marks and it made the text harder to read.
He was right, and the name stuck.

English is not my mother tongue and I am also a littlb eit dyslexic (that's a joke, btw). Writing well is indeed a challenge despite the availability of spelling and grammar checkers.
I was told that the best way to improve is to write, and therefore this blog.
Feedback is welcome.

### Personal

I ride motocross and speed bikes on racetracks, and am also a keen sports photographer. I have published some my best shots [here](https://marco101mx.myportfolio.com/).

I have also started another low-profile blog, where I write about little experiments, such as setting up Ghost on a Raspberry PI, Cloudflare Tunnels and similar stuff.  
If interested, you can find it at [marcoperetti.com](https://marcoperetti.com/)

Oh, I also love [reading](/books)

### Blog template

This web site is based on Lee's Robison [template](https://github.com/leerob/next-mdx-blog) and is running on Vercel. This allows me to keep up to date with with Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and Markdown.
